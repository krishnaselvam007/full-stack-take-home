# Firefly Health Take-home Interview

Hello and thank you for interviewing with Firefly!

This document is not the interview — it is a "pre-brief" to make sure your environment and expectations are properly calibrated before beginning.

Please make sure you read through this document thoroughly. Once you are ready, the detailed prompt can be found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## What to expect

For this project, you'll be building a miniature version of one of Firefly's real tools. You'll also be using a tech stack that is very similar to Firefly's.

Please allocate around 4 hours to dedicate to this project. If it ends up taking longer, we just ask that you submit your solution within 48 hours of getting started.

After receiving your solution, Firefly will schedule a review session, during which you'll present and discuss your solution with some members of our engineering team.

This project is meant to be a realistic demonstration of your full-stack coding abilities. This means that it is perfectly fine to Google, refer to documentation / Stack Overflow, and even install packages that you find useful.

## Base requirements

The starting instructions contain detailed steps to set up both the front-end and back-end. To make that setup easier, have the following tools installed before starting:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 10 (at least)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)

## The Stack / Frameworks

Within this repo is a self-contained project reliant on a few technologies — if you're unfamiliar with any of them, it's recommended to take some time to explore before diving in. We've included some tips and links to documentation below.

### 1) [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)

You'll want to be comfortable building basic Models and Views. Django's [introduction](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) is a great place to start if you're new to it.

### 2) [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

The [Example](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#example) page  is a good starting place.

### 3) [React](https://reactjs.org)

React's [Getting started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page offers a few ways to get familiar with the library. There's no requirement to add any other front-end libraries.

The database is SQLite3, but you shouldn't need to worry about that.

## Getting started and submitting your solution

Please fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

When you're finished and ready to submit your solution, please either include an email link to your fork, or provide your solution as a git bundle over email.

The instructions for the project can be found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

Good luck!
